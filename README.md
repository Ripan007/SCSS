- Sass is a CSS processor.
- A CSS preprocessor is a tool that allows us to automatically generate style sheets, adding features that do not have CSS, and that is typical of programming languages, such as variables, functions, nested selectors, inheritance, etc.

- These characteristics of the processors also allow us to make the generated CSS that more comfortable to maintain and more reusable.
